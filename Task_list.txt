1. Contractors and Partners need to be viewed by Admin (contractor, create contractor, partner and create partner).

--------------------

Please insert the website content for the site and all email confirmations.  see attached.
Project list page - List of Projects title is mispelled
Confirmation email should come from admin@thefixitnetwork.com...currently says admin@fixitnetworks.com
After creating a user (non-admin account) I hit submit, the account creation form remained.  I should be taken to the project list page.  from there the user, based on if they are a new user or a new user associated with an existing project, they should be able to see 0 to many projects
