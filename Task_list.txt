	If the customer is added by a contractor or Admin, then the fields should be defaulted to 'please add details', this should be mandatory when creating a new project as we want to capture the new customer for marketing purposes.
	Contractor list page, for admin, customer and contractor users, they should be able to add add'l contractors here.  need the edit function features on this page identical to documents/tasks, etc.	
	Admin needs to be able to send 'the Fixit Network' user acceptance form to customer or contractor to be added to a project when a contractor is adding a customer as well as when a customer is adding a contractor.  So until a customer and contractor accepts the terms of agreement, their access is disabled.  Will provide a user acceptance form.
	Confirming, item #5 below means...If task owner is not assigned, by default customer is the owner, correct?

-Project Description font size is too big, should be consistent with Project Title font size
-Project Description should be underneath Project name
-Project Description detail should be collapsable 
-Calculations need to occur.  Budget entered, paid from budget, system should calculate the remaining budget. (Budget calculation should be factored in, please confirm you have the formula?)
Referral fee should be 7% of budget.  formula (budget-deductible) x 7% = referral fee.
Need a field called deductible, dollar amount needs to be entered by admin or user only.
