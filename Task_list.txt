		-> Create project (Later)
			-> Will allow the user to enter the company name, description and email ID.
			-> Automatic email will be sent to adjuster/contractor

Permission setting and testing
1. If permission is set and deleted, and if user tries to set the same permission, it is not getting lister.
2. Removed role column from permission

3. Setting of permission
	Questions ()
	1. What is the difference between 
		Service Provider Admin
		Service Provider Agent
		Service provider User
	2. What isthe difference between
		Insurance Admin
		Insurance call center agent
		Adjuster
	3. When we say permission like 
		For Service privider Admin , he has permission to Create, Update, View users of data filter service privoder user.
			> This means a user who is having service provider admin as role has a permission to create, upate and view users with permission service provider user who are assigned to the service provider company ? Is my understanding is correct.
	4. As of now create, update and view of users is under Security > Users which is completely owned by "Super Admin". Do we need to liverage this for other users as well ?

	Also having some more questions related to data verification. Can we have a call by Tomorrow  Morning PST.
