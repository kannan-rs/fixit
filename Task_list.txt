	If the customer is added by a contractor or Admin, then the fields should be defaulted to 'please add details', this should be mandatory when creating a new project as we want to capture the new customer for marketing purposes.
	
	--> When contractor add an new customer, Application could able to send a mail to the customer to fill rest of details.

	Admin needs to be able to send 'the Fixit Network' user acceptance form to customer or contractor to be added to a project when a contractor is adding a customer as well as when a customer is adding a contractor.  So until a customer and contractor accepts the terms of agreement, their access is disabled.  Will provide a user acceptance form.
	Confirming, item #5 below means...If task owner is not assigned, by default customer is the owner, correct?
