3. Specifying roles and perminssions 
4. Tested with permission and fixed some issues
	1. Signup issue directly from website, it was checking for logged in users to do action which is changed, so that not logged in or new customer can register
	2. Fixed login issue for checking status while logging in.
	3. Added check while generating top menus based on dependency[Role Name]
